# Unsaturated Blue
Unsaturated Blue is an Aliucord theme, focusing on using colors that arent neither vibrant neither Grey.

You can use any transparency (except Full) for this theme but I recommend using chat and settings. You can also turn on the font if you want the Ubuntu font.

## Demonstration
(Using Chat and Settings transparency, discord font.)
