## Installation



### Requirements
- Aliucord
- Themer Plugin
- A file manager

### Guide
Download the .json file here and move it to Aliucord/themes folder.

Alternatively, you can also join the Aliucord server, hold the Unsaturated Blue message in #themes, and choose install unsaturatedblue.

You can use any transparency (except Full) but I recommend using chat and settings. You can also turn on the font if you want the Ubuntu font.
