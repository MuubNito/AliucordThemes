# Aliucord Themes
Some of the Aliucord themes that I made. **All of them require a plugin called *Themer*.**

## Requirements
- Aliucord
- Themer Plugin
- Dark Mode

## Guide
To install all themes, join the Aliucord server, hold the theme message in #themes, and choose install unsaturatedblue.




# Peaceful Red (rouged.json)
Peaceful Red is an Aliucord theme that aims to be nice on the eye. It has a red-ish unsaturated pallete.


# Unsaturated Blue
Unsaturated Blue is an Aliucord theme, focusing on using colors that arent neither vibrant neither Grey.

You can use any transparency (except Full) for this theme but I recommend using chat and settings. You can also turn on the font if you want the Ubuntu font.

## Demonstration
(Using Chat and Settings transparency, discord font.)
